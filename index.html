								<p>My name is Matthew Prince</p>
								<p>My student number is S3785148</p>
								<p>My personal email address is mjp00@y7mail.com and my student email address is S3784158@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
								<p>I am half Italian and a mix of other races, i am able to speak serbian as all my best friends are serbian and i speak with their families. However besides serbian and english i know no other languages. I completed my Year 12 VCE studies at Hampton Park Secondary College in 2018. I have now commenced my studies at RMIT in a bachelor of Information Technology.</p> 
								<p>A fun fact about me is that my hobbies include playing games and fishing. In addition too these i spend most my weekends out at partys or clubs.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Intrest in IT</h2>
								<p>My intrest in IT is the endless creative possibilties particularly in the game industry. With these endless possibilties you are able to create a vision of a game or story and bring it too life. The field that orginally drew my intrest in IT was playing pokemon stadium on the old nintendo 64 when i was very young around 6 or 7. This is where my passion for gaming orginally started being able to control a character on a screen and inputting set commands too achieve a set result in this case it was choosing a move and trying too beat your enemy trainers pokemon. Playing pokemon stadium for the first time i was instantly mezmerized and ever since then i have being playing games. This event lead me too seeking further experiences with technology causing me too then on buy the Playstation 2. Where my intrested continued to grow, by the age of 11 I has picked up my first laptop and began to play games such as minecraft and club penguin. That is where i learned how to use the internet too join other servers and communicate with other people around the world. This started my passion for IT and ever since then i have wanted to be able to create my own game and hopefully gaming company.</p>
								<p>I choose to come to RMIT to follow my passion for IT as RMIT is a technology-based school and provides the key knowledge and skills to be able to succeed in the industry. In addition to this I came too RMIT as it was my first preference however, I did not get into the first desired course this being Bachelor of computer science as I did not do math methods. So instead I was accepted into a Bachelor of Information Technology which still enables me to find a job in my desired field this being programming and game making.  </p>
								<p>IT covers a lot of aspects; I hope to learn a broad knowledge on a wide variety of them. Being able to learn a wide knowledge on different parts of IT enables a programmer to be diverse and if a programmer is diverse, they can help others in their field. This is especially important in game making as it is a team effort to create a well working game. I expect to learn the areas Programming and Website development. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="Ideal job.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Ideal job link - https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=9cf7d0a6da9cc61a&tk=1d79erca4bt8k803&from=serp&vjs=3 </p>
								<p>This position requires a programmer too be able to complete a wide variety of tasks such as graphic’s and programming technical aspects of the games. In addition to this you will need to be able to communicate ideas and visions too other in order for the whole team to be on track with the ideas. This position is appealing to me as I love to work with others and have great communication skills and can describe my vision of what should and shouldn’t be done. Along with this I love graphic design as it is a large part of the game and considered to be the front end to a user as the graphics is what the user will see not the code that has been programmed into it. </p>
								<p>You will need strong programming skills in software's such as unity and c++. You will need to be able to motivate yourself and other around you in order to complete each task that is given to the team. You also need to have at least 3 years of experience in the industry and having experience with software's such as unreal engine and current console systems is a plus.  </p>
								<p>The current skills I have is a intermediate level of experience with the software c++ and a small range of knowledge and skill in unity. In the past I have done work experience at AIE (Academy of Interactive Entertainment) and there I learned how to use unity to build a simple game with minimalistic graphics. However, I have no experience in the industry and do not have advanced knowledge on either of the required software's. I do have the skills in communication and am able to talk to anyone without hesitation, in addition I possess great leadership skills and can convey my ideas with ease.  This means that I will be able to talk to fellow programmers and help them resolve any issues that may arise and give my opinion on various ways in which the team can go about solving its problems. </p>
								<p>In order to obtain the qualifications and skills I need for my ideal job I will first have to start of as an entry level programmer. As I plan to move to the USA in hopes of gaining a job with big gaming companies I will start of here in Australia as a small-time programmer working for start-up companies creating website’s and graphics. In addition to this I wish to release my very own game so learning on the job will be a big help towards achieving the skills I need too be able to create my own game. After 3 years of working in the industry I will have gained enough experience too be qualified for my ideal job, however working in the industry will not guarantee me the job, therefore creating my own game will look good on my resume. Not only will it be in my portfolio but if the game is too succeed and do well, I could be scouted by other big companies where I can sell my game too them or work under them creating my own series of games. Along with this creating my own game will give me the knowledge I need in unity and graphic design, allowing me to open my options of my ideal job even further. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Personal Profile</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="Myer briggs.JPG" alt="" /></span>
							        <span class="image main"><img src="personailty.JPG" alt="" /></span>
							        <span class="image main"><img src="learning style.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Based on the Myers Briggs test and the Big Five Personality test the results show that I am very creative and extraverted. This means that I can communicate to others well and can make friends easily in any workplace I enter. Along with this having such a creative mind means I can find solutions too other people's problems and offer them my advice or opinion on any subjects. I also am very emotionally sensitive and worry about what other’s think of me and if I am liked along with this, I want to make sure I can make everyone happy. I am also a visual and auditory learner this means I learn best when something is explained to me and then I complete the task myself enabling me to learn once I have been shown and completed the task. </p>
							        <p>This will affect my behaviour in a team in both a positive and negative way. The positive is that I can communicate with all the team members with confidence and energy however also means that I may be distracted by their personal life issues and try offer them comfort wasting time in the team environment. My learning style also may affect the team as someone will need to explain a set task too me and watch me complete it too ensure I do it correctly, however this will be positive in the team environment as once I have learned the first time I will be able to repeat it and even teach it too others. My creativity will be a positive in the team environment as I am able to think of things that no one else may think of and offer unique solutions too any problem that may arise. Being able to talk to all the team members means in the team environment I will be able to boost their morale and prevent people skipping work as they enjoy too come in and work alongside their colleagues. </p>
							        <p>When forming a team those aspects should be considering. As I am an extravert, I can be paired with either extraverted or introverted people. When paired with another extravert we can communicate well and form a bond straight away allowing for the team to operate smoothly. IF I was to be in a team with introverts it would pose no issue as I would be able to communicate with them as well however it will take time to form a bond with them as they must warm up too my personality. However, I am best too be put into a team with an authority figure as they will keep me on task and keep me from slacking off and wasting time. They also will be able to show me how to solve problems that I may not be familiar with. </p>

						<article id="about2">
								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<p>I want to create a Role-playing game (RPG) as this is a large genre in the gaming industry. My game will be focused on forming character bonds, that when certain actions occur it can make the user feel real emotion as they feel like they are apart of the game. The main focus of the game will be creating multiple choices and multiple ends as seen in games such as ‘Until Dawn’. This project will be a choice-based game that if one action occurs then a multitude of events will unfold due to the players choice. However, unlike games such as Until Dawn it will have fighting aspects from games such as ‘Mortal Kombat ‘and combine these two aspects to form a new genre of game.</p>
							<p>The reason for this project being interesting is that it has never been done before, combining a choice game with such intense fight mechanics. Along with it never being done before the sales of these two example games are high, ‘Until Dawn was the second best-selling software for the week of 29 August 2015, debuting at No. 2 in the UK retail software sales chart’ and the Mortal Kombat franchise has sold over 32.5 million copies. Not only did these two games do well in sales they also received very high reviews from customers and critics. Along with both these games doing well the other motivation for creating this project is that the game industry is projected to be worth 180.1 billion is revenue by the year 2021. However, I wish to see the gaming industry become even bigger than that and therefore I'm interested in creating a game such as this too bring in new customers and grow the industry further. The reason I want this to happen is I am passionate about gaming I believe that it brings people together and is an outlet for anger and stress leading to a happier and healthier life. </p>

https://venturebeat.com/2018/04/30/newzoo-global-games-expected-to-hit-180-1-billion-in-revenues-2021/ </p>
							<p>The features of the project will include the interactions of user and NPC, a story will be told however the story will vary based on user choice and decision. A user decision can lead to a resolution keeping them from fighting or lead too conflict based on the user's attributes in different skills that they choose to learn. The game will also force users to look around for items and scavenge supplies in order to keep their characters alive, this means the user will have to learn the proper preparations to ration their supplies. Some areas of the game will force the user to use flashlights in order to see, the flashlights will need batteries and these batteries will need to be rationed because if the darkness engulfs them, their character will begin to go insane. When a character reaches insanity, this will cause 1 of 3 actions to occur, the first being he kills all other characters in the party leaving only one alive, the second he runs of and dies in the darkness leaving you with your remaining 3 characters, or the 3rd option he develops a tolerance too the insanity and presses on in the dark. However, this 3rd option will only have a 1% chance of occurring the 2nd will have an 89% chance and the first will have a 10% chance. This gives a certain chance to each part of the game and having skills in luck will increase the 3rd options chance, as an incentive for the user to choose luck as their skill. Similar occurrences will happen when characters begin to starve, if a character starve again 3 options will occur. The first option is the character eats one of his party members causing them to die and thus leaving the user with only 3 characters left along with a permanent status effect that the character is now a cannibal and only can eat other people, meaning the user will have to pick fights and harvest the dead bodies in order to keep this character alive. The second option is the character dies from starvation. The 3rd option is that the character drinks any available water in the players inventory which restores the character back too full hunger and also gives the character a permanent buff which enables the character to continue to consume water to gain hunger and thirst. Again, these will all have certain percentage chances and will increase based on the luck skill of the character. But the base chances for option 1 are 10% chance the 2nd a 89% chance and the 3rd a 1% chance. In addition, to these game mechanics the game will be very unforgiving whatever choice you make or whatever occurs in the game is irreversible and you must play the rest of the game with whatever happens or restart from scratch. This game is all about survival and making the right choices along with item management. The fighting aspect of the game occur when you anger an NPC by saying the wrong thing, if your character is too die in this battle then they are permanently dead. However, if you are too emerge victorious then the user takes all the NPC’s items however they all will have special move sets that a player must learn fast and the better the items the harder the difficulty, however it become easier based on the skill strength which a user can decide to choose over luck. By creating this game, it will open a new market of a fighting style RPG game that has not only choices but strategic rationing and fight mechanics. This game is meant to force the user to learn from their mistakes and be one of the hardest games mentally and skill wise bringing together strategy and combat that has never been done before. 
</p>
							<p>The tools and technology needed for this project is the use of unity. Unity will be the software used to create the game graphics and the programming of the whole game. Along with needing this software the computer will need hardware that is viable use in game making. The hardware that would be needed is a core i7 processor accompanied with a Nividia GTX 1080. This hardware is needed as the computer needs to be able to run the game on its best possible graphics in order to see how smooth the gameplay is as well as how well the graphics have been designed. </p>
							<p>The skills required to create a game of this scale would be someone who has a minimum of 3+ year's experience using programs such as unity and c++. The will also need to be able to do graphic design and debugging in order to prevent any errors from arising. In addition, the PC’s will need at least an i7 core processor and a Nividia GTX 1080 or equivalent. It is feasible too find the skills as many game programmers would be happy to have an opportunity to create their own bestselling game, along with this, this style of game does not require 10+ years of experience to create only imagination and 3+ years of experience in programming and graphic design. The cost of hardware that would be needed this being the PC is achievable as each part will cost roughly $1000 and as for the software unity and c++ are free so no cost is occurred there. 
</p>
							<p>The outcome of creating a game of this type creates a whole new market of games it also gives other developers new ideas that they may not have considered and shows how creative a game can become. If the project was to successful it would be opening the gaming market it may even bring new customers who have never played a game before too buy this game and see what the experience is like. Not only will the gaming industry rise but also the Twitch streaming community, with this new game being released it will be streamed as it’s a new experience. By more streamers playing this game it creates a larger audience for the gaming community. This will impact the gaming industry and will cause its value to rise even higher than its original 2021 prediction this being 108.1billion dollars. </p>
